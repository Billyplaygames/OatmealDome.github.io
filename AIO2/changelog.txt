[1.3.1.0] Whoops.

Apologies for the terrible formatting in this text box, it has been fixed in this new version.

Changes:

- Fix a bug where the AIO would say that it is incompatible with the latest Splatoon version
- Update some Octohax offsets
- Make the update prompt prettier

(This is what I get for not testing things before I release.)
